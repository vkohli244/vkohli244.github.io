      <p>Hi! My name is Vinayak Kohli, I am a first year Software Engineering Major.
      </p>
      <p>I started learning computer science through robotics and realized I had more of an interest on the coding.</p>
      <p>Afterwards, I started working on side projects as well as web 
        and mobile applications for students and teachers at my highschool</p>
      <P>which is when I realized I liked Software Engineering.</P>
